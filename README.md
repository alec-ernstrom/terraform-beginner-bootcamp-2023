## Semantic Versioning

Bunch of stuff about **semantic versioning**

- Things to do with semantic versioning
- *More* things to do with semantic versioning
- *Even __more__* things to do with semantic versioning

Very cool! :thumbsup:

## Install the Terraform CLI

The Terraform installation instructions have changed due to gpg keyring changes. Refer to the latest installation instructions for more information.

### Considerations for Linux Distribution + OS Version

This project is built using the Ubuntu distribution of Linux. If your project is anything other than Ubuntu, be aware that you may need to alter the scripts per your distribution. 

How to check distro + version: ```cat /etc/os-release```

[How To Check Which Linux Disribution You're Using](https://www.tecmint.com/check-linux-os-version/#:~:text=The%20best%20way%20to%20determine,on%20almost%20all%20Linux%20systems)

### Refactoring into Bash Scripts

The code provided for a Terraform CLI install is large, so it has been condensed in our Gitpod Task File ([.gitpod.yml](.gitpod.yml)).

Link to the Bash Script provided by Hashi: [./bin/install_terraform_cli](./bin/install_terraform_cli)

### AWS CLI Installation

AWS CLI is installed for this project via a bash script [./bin/install_aws_cli](./bin/install_aws_cli)

[Install or update the latest version of the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

### AWS CLI Env Vars

[AWS CLI Env Vars](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)

Env Vars are stored in both the Gitpod Global Variables, as well as the individual Workspace env vars

### AWS CLI - Check Credentials

```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

### Congfiguring main.tf Providers

When you configure you're provider, you'll need to make sure you add lines for authentication:

```
provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-west-2"
  access_key = "my-access-key"
  secret_key = "my-secret-key"
}
```
*** ^^ THIS IS BAD - DON'T DO THIS**
This method is insecure, because it involves placing your secure keys in clear-text within your configuration file, which is an obvious security concern.

If you only have set your Access Keys in your Global Variables for your Workspace, it you won't be able to finish your init - because the provider config has nothing to reference. You have to specifically call our your env var's using **export**:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="anaccesskey"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="asecretkey"
export AWS_REGION="us-west-2"
terraform plan
```

[Authentication and Configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#authentication-and-configuration)

### Terraform Cloud

If you're using the Terraform Cloud block in your configuration file, you're telling your configuration environment to run IN the cloud, versus locally in your editor, so you need to remember to set environment variables IN the cloud GUI, so that environment can make use of them when referencing whatever API's it needs

From the Terraform Cloud Login page:

```"Terraform Cloud runs Terraform operations and stores state remotely, so you can use Terraform without worrying about the stability of your local machine, or the security of your state file."```

### Creating an alias for Terraform

```
open ~/.bash_profile
```

Place the below lines into the profile

```
alias tf=terraform
```

### Automating the alias to open be included in bash_profile every time you launch the editor

need to add documentation here. Essentially create a file in ``/bin/`` to be referenced, with information about creating the alias. and then in the ``gitpod.yml``, we'll call out that directory where that file exists
