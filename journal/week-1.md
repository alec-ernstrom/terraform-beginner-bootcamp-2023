## Root Module Structure

Out Root Module Structure is as follows:

-PROJECT_ROOT
  - ``variables.tf`` - stores the structure of input variables
  - ``main.tf`` - everything else
  - ``providers.tf`` - defines required providers and their configs
  - ``outputs.tf`` - stores our outputs
  - ``terraform.tfvars`` - the data of variables we want to load into our terraform project
  - ``README.md`` - required for root modules

[Standard Module Strucuture](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/develop/structure)

## Terraform Cloud Variables

In Terraform we can set 2 kinds of variables:

- Environment Variables - ``These are set in your bash terminal``
- Terraform Variables - ``These are set within a file like 'tfvars'``

### Loading Terraform Input Variables

[Terraform Input Variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables)

We can use the `-var` flag to set an input variable or override a variable in the tfvars file.

### var-file flag

- TODO: document this functionality for Terraform Cloud

### terraform.tfvars

This is the default file to load in Terraform variables in bulk

### auto.tfvars

- TODO: document which Terraform Variables take precedence 

## Dealing With Configuration Drift


### Importing Terraform State with ``Import`` and Avoid Replacement

Import will find the existing resource from ID and import it into your Terraform state.

https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import#provider-configuration

When importing a resource using the ``random_string`` resource option, if configuration isn't specifically set, the resource you're importing will be destroyed and recreated the next time ```terraform apply``` is run. The resolution for this is the specifically call out the configuration, as seen in this URL:

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest/docs/resources/string#avoiding-replacement

When using AWS, the ```import``` commands for the AWS provider can be found here:

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket#import

## Fix Using Terraform Refresh 

```sh
terraform apply -refresh-only --auto-approve
```

## Terraform Modules

It is recommended to place modules in a ```modules``` directory when locally developing modules, but this is not a hard and fast rule.

### Passing Input Variables

You'll put theses lines into your ```main.tf``` file for your project, to pass input variables into your module. The module has to declare the Terraform variables in its own ```variables.tf```.

```tf
module "terrahouse_aws" {
  source = "./modules/terrahouse_aws"
  user_uuid = var.user_uuid
  bucket_name = var.bucket_name
}
```

### Modules Sources

Using the source we can import he module from various place eg:

- Locally
- Github
- Terraform Registry

## Considerations with using LLM's

It's important to remember that even though LLM's are helpful for generating code, their learning may have been based on outdated information, which could cause issues for you.

## Working With Files In Terraform

### Path Variable

In Terraform, there is a special variable called `path` that allows us to reference local paths:

- ``path.module`` = Get the path for the current module
- ``path.root`` = Get the path for the root of the module

Use these values carefully, because they include information about the context in which a configuration is being applied and so may inadvertently hurt the portability or composability of a module.

For example, if you use ```path.cwd``` directly to populate a path into a resource argument then later applying the same configuration from a different directory or on a different computer with a different directory structure will cause the provider to consider the change of path to be a change to be applied, even if the path still refers to the same file.

An example of this might look like:

```sh
resource "aws_s3_object" "error_html" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.website_bucket.bucket
  key    = "error.html"
  source = var.error_html_filepath

  etag = filemd5(var.error_html_filepath)
}
```

[References to Named Values](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/references#filesystem-and-workspace-info)

### "```fileexists```" Function

fileexists determines whether a file exists at a given path.

```sh
fileexists(path)
```

Example of this might be:

```sh
condition = fileexists(var.error_html_filepath)
```

[fileexists Terraform Function](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/fileexists)


### "```filemd5```" Function

filemd5 is a variant of md5 that hashes the contents of a given file rather than a literal string.

This is similar to ```md5(file(filename))```, but because file accepts only UTF-8 text it cannot be used to create hashes for binary files.

Example of this might be something like:

```sh
etag = filemd5(var.error_html_filepath)
```

[filemd5 Terraform Function](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/filemd5)

### "```etag```" Argument for "```aws_s3_object```"

"(Optional) Triggers updates when the value changes. The only meaningful value is ```filemd5("path/to/file")```(Terraform 0.11.12 or later) or ```${md5(file("path/to/file"))}``` (Terraform 0.11.11 or earlier). This attribute is not compatible with KMS encryption, ```kms_key_id``` or ```server_side_encryption = "aws:kms"```, also if an object is larger than 16 MB, the AWS Management Console will upload or copy that object as a Multipart Upload, and therefore the ETag will not be an MD5 digest (see ```source_hash``` instead)."

Example might be:

```sh
etag = filemd5(var.error_html_filepath)
```

[aws_s3_object "etag" Argument](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_object#etag)

### Terraform Data Sources

This allows us to source data from Cloud resources. This is useful when referencing cloud resources without needing to import them.

```sh
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

output "account_id" {
  value = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id
}
```

[Data Sources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/data-sources)

### Terraform Locals

A local value assigns a name to an expression, so you can use the name multiple times within a module instead of repeating the expression. They allow you to define local variables.

Examples: 

```sh
locals {
    s3_origin_id = "MyS3Origin"
}
```

[Terraform Local Values](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/locals)

## ```jsonencode``` Function

We used the ```jsonencode``` function to create the json policy inline in the HCL.

## Changing The Lifecycle of Resources

[Meta-arguments - Lifecycle](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle)

## Terraform Data

The terraform_data implements the standard resource lifecycle, but does not directly take any other actions. You can use the terraform_data resource without requiring or configuring a provider. It is always available through a built-in provider with the source address terraform.io/builtin/terraform.

[terraform_data](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/terraform-data)

## Provisioners

SEE FIRST: [Provisioners are a Last Resort!](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax#provisioners-are-a-last-resort)

Provisioners use built-in and third-party software to install and configure the machine image after booting.

Provisioners are not recommended for user because Configuration Management tools like Ansible are better for this type of thing.

[Provisioners](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/docs/provisioners)

## Local Exec

The local-exec provisioner invokes a local executable after a resource is created. This invokes a process on the machine running Terraform, not on the resource. See the ```remote-exec``` provisioner to run commands on the resource.

An example might be:

```sh
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...
  
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo The server's IP address is ${self.private_ip}"
  }
}
```

[local-exec](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/local-exec)

## Remote Exec

The ```remote-exec``` provisioner invokes a script on a remote resource after it is created. This can be used to run a configuration management tool, bootstrap into a cluster, etc. To invoke a local process, see the ```local-exec``` provisioner instead. The ```remote-exec``` provisioner requires a connection and supports both ssh and winrm.

Example:

```sh
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  # Establishes connection to be used by all
  # generic remote provisioners (i.e. file/remote-exec)
  connection {
    type     = "ssh"
    user     = "root"
    password = var.root_password
    host     = self.public_ip
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "puppet apply",
      "consul join ${aws_instance.web.private_ip}",
    ]
  }
}
```
[remote-exec](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/remote-exec)

## For_Each Arguements

By default, a resource block configures one real infrastructure object (and similarly, a module block includes a child module's contents into the configuration one time). However, sometimes you want to manage several similar objects (like a fixed pool of compute instances) without writing a separate block for each one. Terraform has two ways to do this: ```count``` and ```for_each```.

```sh
[for s in var.list : upper(s)]
```
